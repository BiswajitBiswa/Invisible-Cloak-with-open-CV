# Invisible-Cloak-with-open-CV
Color detection||Image segmentation
Opposite to green screening we remove the foreground here.
# STEPS
    1.Capture and store the background frame
    2.Detect the defined color using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
    3.Segment out the defined colored part by generating a mask.
    4.Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. [ output.avi ]
# Libraries--
  cv2
  time
  numpy
 You will need to update the HSV value of the colour you choose accordingly in the code.
# How To Use--Run clock.py in the interpreter--
 Once you run the code wait for a few seconds, let the webcam capture the background image then you can come inside the frame with your magical Cloak and be invisible ; )
